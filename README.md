#Starter Project
##Purpose
  * Assess your ability to take some general specs to a working demo
  * Gives us something to talk about
  * Shouldn't take more than 4 hours
  * Don't make it too complex

##Spec
###Need to have
  * Chef cookbook[s], structure as you see fit.
  * Implement a Linux, MySQL, HHVM, Nginx single host running some sort of blog software (take your pick)
  * Base OS should be ubuntu 14.04
  * Use Berkshelf for dependancy management, please no vendor drops (but version locks are good!)
  * Should leverage community cookbooks when it make sense.
  * Recipe should be testable using Vagrant.
 
  ###Nice to have
  * Security hardening and user management.
  * Should converge both in chef-zero and chef-client modes.
  * Take care with secrets!
  * Funcitonal/Unit/Lint tests are cool.
  * Think in terms of re-usable components.
  * Bonus points for a rake/Thor file for common tasks.
